## Recommendation

- Upgrade Wifi in airplane, In the data we can see that our returning customers are unhappy about Wifi in plane, first time customers also have similar disatisfaction.
- Improve Online Booking system for better user experience, both first time and returnin..
- Increase choice of time slot, our first time customers are not satisfied with current time slot of depart and arrive. Provide more time slot can improve satisfaction and increase return rate in future.
